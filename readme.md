# Smart Contract with MetaMask Integration

This project demonstrates how to connect a user's MetaMask wallet to a web application, fetch wallet details (such as Ether and Wei balance), and display them on the page. It leverages Web3.js for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and Petite Vue for managing state and reactivity.

## Features:
- **MetaMask Integration**: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to the application.
- **Balance Display**: Once connected, the user's wallet balance is displayed in both Ether and Wei.
- **Responsive UI**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, ensuring the app is responsive and clean across devices.

## Technologies Used:
- **MetaMask**: A browser extension for managing Ethereum wallets.
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Petite Vue**: Lightweight reactive framework for handling the app's state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
